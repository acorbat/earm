Overview
========

PySB implementations of Bcl2-models from the group of Pingping Shen, along with
other derived, closely related models.

In a series of papers from 2007-2010, the research group of Pingping Shen
implemented and investigated models of Bcl-2 family interactions. In this file
we have re-implemented these models using PySB. We have also included a model
from [Howells2011]_ which is a fairly straightforward extension of a
Shen group model from [Chen2007biophysj]_.

MOMP model implementations
--------------------------

The implementations of the various models are contained within the
following functions:

- :py:func:`chen_biophys_j`
- :py:func:`chen_febs_indirect`
- :py:func:`chen_febs_direct`
- :py:func:`cui_direct`
- :py:func:`cui_direct1`
- :py:func:`cui_direct2`
- :py:func:`howells`

Model descriptions (with references) are available in the documentation for
each function.

The models are closely related, and many of the later models are derived from
earlier ones. The models have been implemented in such a way as to make this
hierarchy transparent.

Shared functions
----------------

In addition to the implementations of the models themselves, this file also
contains two macros that are re-used by the various models:

- :py:func:`momp_monomers`, which declares the Bcl-2 molecule types used in the
  models, and
- :py:func:`shen_pore_transport`, which declares the set of transport reactions
  required for the release of Cytochrome c and Smac.

Parameter values
----------------

In the original papers, species quantities and forward rate constants were
either given in units of micromolar ([Chen2007biophysj]_, [Howells2011]_) or
nanomolar ([Chen2007febs]_, [Cui2008]_).  For consistency, these values have
been written in terms of their molar equivalents (for example, 0.1uM = 0.1e-6 M;
3 uM^-1 s^1 = 3e6 M^-1 s^-1).  Concentrations have been converted into units of
numbers of molecules according to:

No. of molecules = Conc * N_A * vol

where N_A is Avogadro's number and vol is the cell volume, which is given a
default value in the global variable `V` defined in :doc:`shared`.
Similarly, forward rate constants are converted into stochastic rate constants
according to:

Stoch. rate constant = Det. rate constant / (N_A * vol)

# The Shen model functions share some logic that is contained in the following
# two functions.

def momp_monomers():
    """Declares the signatures of the Bcl-2 family monomers used in all of the
    Shen models.

    In principle, each Shen MOMP model implementation could declare its own
    set of Bcl-2 monomers, each with its own site and state signature. In the
    interest of consistency, a unified set of monomer signatures that supports
    all of the models is defined here.

    # be both Cytosolic and Mitochondrial. To support the Bad phosphorylation
    # model of [Howells2011]_ we also add a site "serine", with three
    # states (Unphosphorylated, Phosphorylated, and Bound (i.e., to 14-3-3

    # **Cytochrome  C and Smac**. We include these species here so that the
    # the Shen models can optionally implement CytoC/Smac release. This allows
    # them to interface with the downstream apoptotic machinery when composed
    # into a larger model. Both Cytochrome C and Smac have three states:
    # Mitochondrial (the initial state), Cytosolic (for after release) and

    Model features (see the source code):

    * Activation of Bax by an activator (tBid) in a one-step, hit-and-run
      manner; Bax activation is reversible.
    * Bcl2 binds both tBid and Bax Bax can displace tBid from Bcl-2 (but not
      the reverse).
    * If Bax oligomerization is incorporated into the model (see
      `do_pore_assembly` argument, below), then this occurs as a spontaneous,
      order 4 reaction.

    This model combines both "direct" type and "indirect" type elements in
    that Bcl-2 is capable of binding both Bid and Bax (see `bind_table` call
    in the source code).

    Parameters
    ----------
    do_pore_assembly : True (default) or False
        If True, adds the formation of Bax oligomers to the model. If False,
        the model's most downstream element is Bax activation. This is included
        for two reasons: first, the original publication included two variant
        models, one with and one without Bax oligomerization, so this allows
        this aspect of the original models to be explored. Second, it allows
        a model that extends this model to implement a different model of Bax
        pore assembly (for example, as is the case with cui_direct).
    do_pore_transport : True or False (default)
        If True, adds the release of Cytochrome C and Smac to the model by
        calling the function :py:func:`shen_pore_transport`. If CytoC/Smac
        release are not incorporated into the model, the model matches the
        originally published model but can't be composed into the full
        extrinsic apoptosis pathway.
